<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part One ---</h2><p>Your flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the easiest way down to the coast from here is via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toboggan" target="_blank">toboggan</a>.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day. "Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!" You ask if you can take a look.</p>
<p>Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the <span title="To ensure your safety, your password must be the following string...">Official Toboggan Corporate Policy</span> that was in effect when they were chosen.</p>
<p>To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of <em>passwords</em> (according to the corrupted database) and <em>the corporate policy when that password was set</em>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have the following list:</p>
<pre><code>1-3 a: abcde
1-3 b: cdefg
2-9 c: ccccccccc
</code></pre>
<p>Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. For example, <code>1-3 a</code> means that the password must contain <code>a</code> at least <code>1</code> time and at most <code>3</code> times.</p>
<p>In the above example, <code><em>2</em></code> passwords are valid. The middle password, <code>cdefg</code>, is not; it contains no instances of <code>b</code>, but needs at least <code>1</code>. The first and third passwords are valid: they contain one <code>a</code> or nine <code>c</code>, both within the limits of their respective policies.</p>
<p><em>How many passwords are valid</em> according to their policies?</p>
